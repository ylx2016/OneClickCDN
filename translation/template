How would you like to proceed?|
1: I know the absolute path to my certificate files (private key, certificate, CA chain (optional)).|
2: I have pointed my domain name to this server, and I want a free Let's Encrypt certificate.|
3: I forgot the path to my certificate files, so I need to go back to SSH and find them; or I do not need SSL certificate for this domain.|
Please select 1, 2, or 3:|

Checking Traffic Server installation|
Traffic Server not installed.  Would you like to install it now?|
Depending on your server specs, you may or may not need to add some SWAP before you proceed.|
This script needs 1500 MB of RAM for the first time to build from source.  It runs perfectly on a 512 MB VPS once it finishes the installation.|
If you think you don't have enough RAM now, please quit, add more SWAP, and run this script again.|
Please indicate if you would like to install now:|
Aborted!|
Please proceed to the next step and add your first CDN website.|
